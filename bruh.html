        <p>Big 3</p>
        <p>The nickname "The Big Three" came about due to their immense worldwide popularity and length. With that, they were always featured in front of the shared Shonen Jump covers and always had bigger images for their main protagonists: Luffy, Naruto and Ichigo. All three series ran for at least 15 years and 70 volumes, and all three overlapped in publication from 2001-2014.</p>
        <p>While the three series weren't the biggest sellers in the magazine, Hunter x Hunter sold more per volume than Bleach for example, they kept their position on the covers due to their overall popularity.</p>
        <p>These three manga have each received long running anime series, Bleach (2004-2012) has 366 episodes, Naruto (including Shippuden) has 720 episodes, and One Piece has 1074 episodes as of September 2023, with One Piece, Naruto Shippuden's sequel Boruto, and the Bleach sequel series Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War still being produced. These statistics do not include the spin-offs, sequels, movies, or One Piece's live-action show, so the full numbers for entire franchises are higher.</p>
        <p>All three are shonen series, which usually focus on topics such as adventure, growth, and action. This genre normally has a lot of subplots and one main, overarching plot. Fighting is also a main part of most shonen series: the protagonists almost always have a superpower and are very muscle headed in nature.</p>
